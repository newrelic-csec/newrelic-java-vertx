# New Relic Java Instrumentation for Vert.x Event Bus

Provides instrumentation code for monitoring the Vert.x Event Bus.  Tracks flow across the event bus.

 Vertx-Verticles provides instrumentation for classes extends AbstractVerticle.  It does this by instrumenting each class that is deployed.  It tracks all methods except those defined by AbstractVerticle. Methods not tracked: 	start, stop, rxStart, rxStop, config, deploymentID, getVertx, init, processArgs.


## Installation

To install the instrumentation:
1. Download the latest release.
2. In the New Relic Java Agent directory, create a directory named extensions if it does not already exist.
3. Copy the downloaded jar files into the extensions directory
4. Restart the Vert.x instance.  

## Getting Started

## Usage

## Building

If you make changes to the instrumentation code and need to build the instrumentation jars, follow these steps
1. Set environment variable NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR.  Its value should be the directory where you want to build the jars (i.e. the extensions directory of the Java Agent).   
2. Build one or all of the jars.   
  a. To build one jar, run the command:  gradlew _moduleName_:clean  _moduleName_:install    
  b. To build all jars, run the command: gradlew clean install

## Testing

Not currently supported.  Will be supported in the future

## Verifying
To verify that the module will load into the Java Agent used the verifyInstrumentation option
see https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-gradle-verify-instrumentation for more information
